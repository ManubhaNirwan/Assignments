    <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity.In certain sports such as racing, many contestants
        may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two
        sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single
        winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be
        arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in
        a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>
